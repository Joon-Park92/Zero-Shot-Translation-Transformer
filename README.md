## Requirements
  
## File description
  * `preprocessor.py` download & preprocess data ( you can use OpenSubtitle2018 / MultiUN dataset )
  * `model.py` define transformer model
  * `data_loader.py` define class for dataload
  * `model_layer.py` has all layers need for transformer
  * `train.py` for training model
  * `eval.py` is for evaluation.

## Training
* STEP 1. Edit the hyperparams.py
* STEP 2. Run preprocessor.py , it will preprocess and make training data 
* STEP 3. Run train.py to train your model
* STEP 4. Run `eval.py` to save result
